    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the Camera course, we learned perspectives about computer vision + Sensor fusion with [Timo Rehfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timo-rehfeld/de).(Engineer at Mercedes-Benz R&D, Autonomous Driving) professional from [MBRDNA](https://www.mbrdna.com/) (Mercedes-Benz Reasearch & Development North America, Inc) team. and the software approach was teached by [Prof. Dr Andreas Haja](https://de.linkedin.com/in/andreas-haja) (professor and autonomous vehicle expert).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project lets Engineering a Collision Detection System, working with the collision detection basics, and estimating the time-to-collision (TTC) with Lidar and Camera.\n",
    "A collision avoidance system (CAS) is an active safety feature that warns drivers or even triggers the brake in the event of an imminent collision with an object in the path of driving. If a preceding vehicle is present, the CAS continuously estimates the TTC. When the TTC falls below a lower threshold, the CAS can then decide to either warn the driver of the imminent danger or - depending on the system - apply the vehicle brakes autonomously. \n",

    "\n",
    "This exercise is about conducting tests with the final project code, especially with regard to the Lidar part. Look for several examples where you have the impression that the Lidar-based TTC estimate is way off. Once you have found those, describe your observations and provide a sound argumentation why you think this happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is complete once several examples (2-3) have been identified and described in detail. The assertion that the TTC is off should be based on manually estimating the distance to the rear of the preceding vehicle from a top view perspective of the Lidar points.\n",

    "It is possible identify the TTC decreasing along each frame, but this is possible due the best fit line showing this tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the frames 3,6 and 14 the TTC estimate are way off.The possible reasons could be due the vehicle dynamic  behavior for both cars the ego and the preceding vehicle. if we have a pitch and bouncing condition , the reference face of mesurement will oscilate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility may be the oscillation of the light caused by the shadow of vehicles around, modifying the reflective properties and increasing the sensor noises\n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text |width=250px | align=\"middle\"][image16] \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible identify that the detector is the principal variable and we have a minimum oscillation regard the descriptor chosen. the Detector AKAZE , FAST , SHITOMASI and SIFT seems  be the best choice because they have the lowest errors considering the best fit line generated by Lidar. The Detectors Harris Corner and ORB do not return reliable results and must be desconsidered.\n",

    "## Conclusion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For both studies Lidar and Camera was possible identify that we have noises on the interest value that we are calculating from this sensors. As it was mentioned in the Classes, the Kalman Filter ( future lesson) is a important tools to minimize this noises and increase the reliability for both sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regard the Camera 2D features (Detectors & Descriptor), the plot below is the final graphic presented in [Camera - 2D Fetures Project](https://github.com/eduribeirocampos/CAMERA_2D_Feature_Matching), and after a lot of comparison and evaluation, it was possible affirm that BRIEF is de best Descriptor and we see the behavior of each Detector regard quantity of Keypoints identified and the elapsed time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text |width=250px | align=\"middle\"][image18]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the results from TTC and process performances the pair `SHITOMASI + BRIEF` is a good Option for the CAS Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Future studies , all the detectors and descriptor have a lot of parameters that must be investigated in order to make a fine tuning and maybe we can produce different conclusion.\n",
